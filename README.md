## What is Mizanly?

Mizanly (ميزانلي — "my balance" in Arabic) is a full-featured social media platform built exclusively for the global Muslim community. Rather than building yet another niche app, Mizanly reimagines the entire social experience through an Islamic lens — bringing together five distinct "spaces" that replicate and enhance the functionality of Instagram, TikTok, X/Twitter, WhatsApp, and YouTube.

Every pixel, every interaction, and every feature is designed with Islamic values, Arabic-first typography, and cultural sensitivity at its core. From Qibla compass integration to Ramadan-aware theming, from scholar verification badges to halal content filtering — Mizanly is social media built for the Ummah.

**Brand Identity:**
- Primary: Emerald `#0A7B4F` (growth, paradise, Islam)
- Accent: Gold `#C8963E` (heritage, scholarship, warmth)
- Dark-mode primary interface
- Arabic RTL support throughout
- Domain: `mizanly.app`

## The Five Spaces

Mizanly is organized into five distinct "spaces" (فضاءات), each named in Arabic and modeled after a leading social platform:

| Space | Arabic | Meaning | Inspired By | Core Experience |
|-------|--------|---------|-------------|-----------------|
| **Saf** | الصف | "The Row" (prayer row) | Instagram | Photo/video feed, stories, highlights, reels, visual sharing, creator storefronts |
| **Bakra** | بكرة | "Tomorrow" | TikTok | Full-screen vertical video, duets, stitches, effects, trending audio, templates |
| **Majlis** | المجلس | "The Gathering" | X/Twitter | Threaded discussions, replies, trending topics, polls, curated lists |
| **Risalah** | رسالة | "The Message" | WhatsApp | 1:1 & group messaging, voice/video calls, broadcasts, stickers, encryption |
| **Minbar** | المنبر | "The Pulpit" | YouTube | Long-form video, channels, subscriptions, playlists, live streaming, audio rooms |

## Local Development with Docker

The `docker-compose.yml` provides local instances of all infrastructure services:

```yaml
services:
  postgres:                   # PostgreSQL 16 Alpine
    port: 5432
    credentials: postgres/postgres
    database: mizanly

  redis:                      # Redis 7 Alpine
    port: 6379
    maxmemory: 256mb

  meilisearch:                # Meilisearch v1.11
    port: 7700
    master key: configurable
```

```bash
# Start all services
docker compose up -d

# Stop all services
docker compose down

# Reset database
docker compose down -v        # Warning: deletes all data
docker compose up -d
```
